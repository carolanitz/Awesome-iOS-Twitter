#### Deleting 

Typical reasons for deleting twitterhandles:

- No updates / no longer tweets

#### Twitter Accounts are ineligible if:

- Lack recent tweets
- Not tweeting mostly in English
- Tweeting about politics: We're an international development community from all around the world, we try to avoid linking to iOS developers that tweet a lot about politics
